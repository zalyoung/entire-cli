# Entire CLI

Entire hooks into your Git workflow to capture AI agent sessions as you work. Sessions are indexed alongside commits, creating a searchable record of how code was written in your repo.

With Entire, you can:

* **Understand why code changed** — see the full prompt/response transcript and files touched
* **Recover instantly** — rewind to a known-good checkpoint when an agent goes sideways and resume seamlessly
* **Keep Git history clean** — preserve agent context on a separate branch
* **Onboard faster** — show the path from prompt → change → commit
* **Maintain traceability** — support audit and compliance requirements when needed

## Requirements

- Git
- macOS or Linux (Windows via WSL)
- [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code), [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli), or [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai/docs/cli/) installed and authenticated

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install via Homebrew
brew tap entireio/tap
brew install entireio/tap/entire

# Or install via Go
go install github.com/entireio/cli/cmd/entire@latest

# Enable in your project
cd your-project && entire enable

# Check status
entire status
```

## Typical Workflow

### 1. Enable Entire in Your Repository

```
entire enable
```

This installs agent and git hooks to work with your AI agent (Claude Code, Gemini CLI or OpenCode). You'll be prompted to select which agents to enable. To enable a specific agent non-interactively, use `entire enable --agent <name>` (e.g., `entire enable --agent opencode`).

The hooks capture session data at specific points in your workflow. Your code commits stay clean—all session metadata is stored on a separate `entire/checkpoints/v1` branch.

**When checkpoints are created** depends on your chosen strategy (default is `manual-commit`):
- **Manual-commit**: Checkpoints are created when you or the agent make a git commit
- **Auto-commit**: Checkpoints are created after each agent response

### 2. Work with Your AI Agent

Just use Claude Code, Gemini CLI, or OpenCode normally. Entire runs in the background, tracking your session:

```
entire status  # Check current session status anytime
```

### 3. Rewind to a Previous Checkpoint

If you want to undo some changes and go back to an earlier checkpoint:

```
entire rewind
```

This shows all available checkpoints in the current session. Select one to restore your code to that exact state.

### 4. Resume a Previous Session

To restore the latest checkpointed session metadata for a branch:

```
entire resume <branch>
```

Entire checks out the branch, restores the latest checkpointed session metadata (one or more sessions), and prints command(s) to continue.

### 5. Disable Entire (Optional)

```
entire disable
```

Removes the git hooks. Your code and commit history remain untouched.

## Key Concepts

### Sessions

A **session** represents a complete interaction with your AI agent, from start to finish. Each session captures all prompts, responses, files modified, and timestamps.

**Session ID format:** `YYYY-MM-DD-<UUID>` (e.g., `2026-01-08-abc123de-f456-7890-abcd-ef1234567890`)

Sessions are stored separately from your code commits on the `entire/checkpoints/v1` branch.

### Checkpoints

A **checkpoint** is a snapshot within a session that you can rewind to—a "save point" in your work.

**When checkpoints are created:**

- **Manual-commit strategy**: When you or the agent make a git commit
- **Auto-commit strategy**: After each agent response

**Checkpoint IDs** are 12-character hex strings (e.g., `a3b2c4d5e6f7`).

### How It Works

```
Your Branch                    entire/checkpoints/v1
     │                                  │
     ▼                                  │
[Base Commit]                           │
     │                                  │
     │  ┌─── Agent works ───┐           │
     │  │  Step 1           │           │
     │  │  Step 2           │           │ 
     │  │  Step 3           │           │
     │  └───────────────────┘           │
     │                                  │
     ▼                                  ▼
[Your Commit] ─────────────────► [Session Metadata]
     │                           (transcript, prompts,
     │                            files touched)
     ▼
```

Checkpoints are saved as you work. When you commit, session metadata is permanently stored on the `entire/checkpoints/v1` branch and linked to your commit.

### Strategies

Entire offers two strategies for capturing your work:

| Aspect              | Manual-Commit                            | Auto-Commit                                        |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Code commits        | None on your branch                      | Created automatically after each agent response    |
| Safe on main branch | Yes                                      | Use caution - creates commits on active branch     |
| Rewind              | Always possible, non-destructive         | Full rewind on feature branches; logs-only on main |
| Best for            | Most workflows - keeps git history clean | Teams wanting automatic code commits               |

### Git Worktrees

Entire works seamlessly with [git worktrees](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-worktree). Each worktree has independent session tracking, so you can run multiple AI sessions in different worktrees without conflicts.

### Concurrent Sessions

Multiple AI sessions can run on the same commit. If you start a second session while another has uncommitted work, Entire warns you and tracks them separately. Both sessions' checkpoints are preserved and can be rewound independently.

entire enable --strategy auto-commit

# Force reinstall hooks
entire enable --force

# Save settings locally (not committed to git)
entire enable --local
```

## Configuration

Entire uses two configuration files in the `.entire/` directory:

### settings.json (Project Settings)

Shared across the team, typically committed to git:

```json
{
  "strategy": "manual-commit",
  "enabled": true
}
```

### settings.local.json (Local Settings)

Personal overrides, gitignored by default:

```json
{
  "enabled": false,
  "log_level": "debug"
}
```

### Configuration Options

| Option                               | Values                           | Description                                          |
|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `enabled`                            | `true`, `false`                  | Enable/disable Entire                                |
| `log_level`                          | `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error` | Logging verbosity                                    |
| `strategy`                           | `manual-commit`, `auto-commit`   | Session capture strategy                             |
| `strategy_options.push_sessions`     | `true`, `false`                  | Auto-push `entire/checkpoints/v1` branch on git push |
| `strategy_options.summarize.enabled` | `true`, `false`                  | Auto-generate AI summaries at commit time            |
| `telemetry`                          | `true`, `false`                  | Send anonymous usage statistics to Posthog           |

### Agent Hook Configuration

Each agent stores its hook configuration in its own directory. When you run `entire enable`, hooks are installed in the appropriate location for each selected agent:

| Agent | Hook Location | Format |
|-------|--------------|--------|
| Claude Code | `.claude/settings.json` | JSON hooks config |
| Gemini CLI | `.gemini/settings.json` | JSON hooks config |
| OpenCode | `.opencode/plugins/entire.ts` | TypeScript plugin |

You can enable multiple agents at the same time — each agent's hooks are independent. Entire detects which agents are active by checking for installed hooks, not by a setting in `settings.json`.

### Auto-Summarization

When enabled, Entire automatically generates AI summaries for checkpoints at commit time. Summaries capture intent, outcome, learnings, friction points, and open items from the session.

```json
{
  "strategy_options": {
    "summarize": {
      "enabled": true
    }
  }
}
```

**Requirements:**
- Claude CLI must be installed and authenticated (`claude` command available in PATH)
- Summary generation is non-blocking: failures are logged but don't prevent commits

**Note:** Currently uses Claude CLI for summary generation. Other AI backends may be supported in future versions.

### Settings Priority

Local settings override project settings field-by-field. When you run `entire status`, it shows both project and local (effective) settings.

### Gemini CLI

Gemini CLI support is currently in preview. Entire can work with [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli) as an alternative to Claude Code, or alongside it — you can have multiple agents' hooks enabled at the same time.

To enable:

```bash
entire enable --agent gemini
```

All commands (`rewind`, `status`, `doctor`, etc.) work the same regardless of which agent is configured.

If you run into any issues with Gemini CLI integration, please [open an issue](https://github.com/entireio/cli/issues).

### OpenCode

OpenCode support is currently in preview. Entire can work with [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai/docs/cli/) as an alternative to Claude Code, or alongside it — you can have multiple agents' hooks enabled at the same time.

To enable:

```bash
entire enable --agent opencode
```

Or select OpenCode from the interactive agent picker when running `entire enable`.

All commands (`rewind`, `status`, `doctor`, etc.) work the same regardless of which agent is configured.

If you run into any issues with OpenCode integration, please [open an issue](https://github.com/entireio/cli/issues).

## Security & Privacy

**Your session transcripts are stored in your git repository** on the `entire/checkpoints/v1` branch. If your repository is public, this data is visible to anyone.

Entire automatically redacts detected secrets (API keys, tokens, credentials) when writing to `entire/checkpoints/v1`, but redaction is best-effort. Temporary shadow branches used during a session may contain unredacted data and should not be pushed. See [docs/security-and-privacy.md](docs/security-and-privacy.md) for details.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

| Issue                    | Solution                                                                                  |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| "Not a git repository"   | Navigate to a Git repository first                                                        |
| "Entire is disabled"     | Run `entire enable`                                                                       |
| "No rewind points found" | Work with your configured agent and commit (manual-commit) or wait for an agent response (auto-commit) |
| "shadow branch conflict" | Run `entire reset --force`                                                                |

### SSH Authentication Errors

If you see an error like this when running `entire resume`:

```
Failed to fetch metadata: failed to fetch entire/checkpoints/v1 from origin: ssh: handshake failed: ssh: unable to authenticate, attempted methods [none publickey], no supported methods remain
```

This is a [known issue with go-git's SSH handling](https://github.com/go-git/go-git/issues/411). Fix it by adding GitHub's host keys to your known_hosts file:

```
ssh-keyscan -t rsa github.com >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts
ssh-keyscan -t ecdsa github.com >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts
```

### Debug Mode

```
# Via environment variable
ENTIRE_LOG_LEVEL=debug entire status

# Or via settings.local.json
{
  "log_level": "debug"
}
```

### Resetting State

```
# Reset shadow branch for current commit
entire reset --force

# Disable and re-enable
entire disable && entire enable --force
```

### Accessibility

For screen reader users, enable accessible mode:

```
export ACCESSIBLE=1
entire enable
```

This uses simpler text prompts instead of interactive TUI elements.
